# Heart Failure Prediction Using ANN
This is the code for project of the Heart Failure Prediction Using ANN : The dataset used to train ANN models to predict whether a patient with heart failure is likely to die during the follow-up period. This information can be used to help doctors make better decisions about patient care.

## Files

- `Heart Failure Prediction Using ANN.ipynb`: Contains of all the code for loading and preprocessing data and bulid the model .
- `heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv`: contains the dataset used in this model
